# Collage-Generator
The Image Collage Generator is a Python-based project designed to create collages from a set of input images. The process involves analyzing the average color of each image, using these color features to strategically place images within the collage, and ultimately producing a visually appealing arrangement.

### Key Features:

1)  Image Processing: The project uses OpenCV to read and analyze the input images. It calculates the average color of each image, which serves as a feature for arranging images in the collage.
2)  Feature Extraction: The project extracts color features from images by computing the average color (RGB) values. These features are used to determine the placement of each image in the collage.
3)  Collage Creation: By utilizing the extracted color features, the project creates a collage that arranges images in a visually harmonious manner, balancing colors and image placements for an aesthetically pleasing result.
4)  Customization: The project allows for customization in terms of the number of images, their arrangement, and the final dimensions of the collage.

### Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language used.
K-Means Clustering: An unsupervised machine learning technique designed to group unlabeled examples based on their similarity to each other. 
OpenCV: A computer vision library used for image processing.
Numpy: Used for efficient numerical operations on image data.
